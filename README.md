# ZeroTier Self Build UI
A console UI for people who selfbuild. May be used for linux and windows
(This is due to the fact self-building does not include the UI)

# Installation
Really easy, clone and run the install script as admin/root.

.BAT is for windows (duh) and .SH is for linux.
## WARNING
By default both the zt (for unix/linux) and zt.bat (windows) use python3 instead of python. If your python 3 uses python instead of python3.

(I am running python3 C:\zt.py)

You will need to change it if it is different for you
